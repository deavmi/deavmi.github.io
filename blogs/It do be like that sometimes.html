    <div align="left">So I have been giving some thought to the idea of
      starting my own blog which is not only cringe but also means I
      will never be a Chad because only Soy-boys write blogs.<br>
    </div>
    <div align="center"><br>
      <div align="left">Okay, now that I have made sure only people on
        the political right are still paying attention, we may continue.
        I was thinking of basically writing on the stuff I am currently
        working on, so no posts about like my trips to, I don't know,
        Portugal but rather academically interesting stuff. I might
        write either about my projects or maybe write tutorial posts
        that explain certain concepts that I have encountered along the
        way, either way I think it will be enjoyable not only for me but
        for more audience *crickets*.<br>

      <div align="left"><br>
        As of now I am working on three things really, CRXN, BonoboNET
        and Bester. I will probably write a post in the near future
        explaining what they are but basically an private IPv4 Internet,
        an IRC network and (oh boy) something that is like XMPP except
        that it's generalized, okay, XMPP is too but I think mine is
        cooler just cause I am working on it.<br>
      </div>
      <div align="left"><br>
        Anyways, that's all for now. I have to grind at some posts
        explaining what the last mentioned project is so that I can
        actually make sure you guys know what it is and can say "Oh,
        that's neat".<br>
