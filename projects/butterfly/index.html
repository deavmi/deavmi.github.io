      <h2>What is Butterfly?</h2>
      <p>Butterfly is a new email protocol that has been designed from
        scratch to take modern standards into<br>
        account, to be simple in design and also modular in terms of
        mail filtering by using <a href="/projects/bester">bester</a>
        as a backend<br>
        for message filtering (both inbound and outbound mail).<br>
      </p>
      <h2>Why use it?</h2>
      <p>The old email protocols namely SMTP and IMAP/POP, firstly, are
        two separate protocols for what<br>
        should be a single protocol - a protocol for email.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Secondly, the single protocol that butterfly is, is very simple
        too and easy to manipulate too due<br>
        to it being based on JSON.<br>
