      <h3>What is CRXN?<br>
      </h3>
      <b>CRXN</b> is a community run IPv4-based computer network running
      on the 10.0.0.0/8 (255.0.0.0) private subnet.<br>
      The purpose of the network is to experiment with networking
      hardware and software and have a network<br>
      where people are free to run what they want, easily - as was
      intended with IPv4.<br>

      <h3>Getting peered and assigned<br>
      </h3>
      Getting peered (via physical medium or over a tunnel) is the first
      step of getting onto the network.<br>
      Secondly one will need to be assigned a subnet on the 10/8 range
      and then have those details<br>
      entered into our (primitive) subnet allocations system (a text
      file).<br>

      For now we don't really have a news source regarding the network
      and its going-ons<br>
      but I, Deavmi, hve a Mastodon account that you can find on my <a
        href="../../">homepage</a> where I often,<br>
      under the hash tag #CRXN, post updates about the project and what
      I am doing to my part<br>
      of the network locally.<br>
