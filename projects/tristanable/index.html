      <h3>What is it though?<br>
      </h3>
      <b>Tristanable</b> is a library I created, like <b>bformat</b>,
      to ease the development of a lot of projects I<br>
      am working on during this time that require similar baseline
      protocols to work. In the case<br>
      of the former, I wanted a library that would solve the problem as
      described below (this is by<br>
      far the best way I can describe the use of this project):<br>
      <br>
      So you first have a client and a server. The client sends jobs to
      the server and the server then<br>
      executes them on separate threads, sending back a reply for the
      job completed. Now a job<br>
      entails the client sending something to the server, the server
      doing some work for that job on<br>
      a separate thread and then sending that reply back to the client.
      The jobs, in this example, are<br>
      independent of each other, so the order you send them in and get
      their results back doesn't matter<br>
      but you just have to get, in this case, the two of them back.<br>
      <br>
      Here is the performance problem that occurs, say now performing
      job 1, the first send-work-reply<br>
      procedure that occurs, takes 1 hour and only after a blocking
      receive after that 1 hour can you<br>
      proceed to then do the next blocking receive (after a send of
      course) for job 2? You see, we could<br>
      have gotten job 2 back first whilst job 1 was working (the
      implication that job one takes significantly<br>
      less time than job 1). But this implies the server waiting for job
      1 to complete and then only queuing it<br>
      to the network buffer for sending and then queuing the server-side
      finished job 2 to it as well.<br>
      <br>
      The solution? Well the job context is derived from the state
      machine implied by the ordering of the<br>
      socket calls but if we go out of order we then need order again,
      we can simply tag the messages - <b>this is<br>
        what tristanable does!<br>
        <br>
      </b>Tristanable watches the socket, and in this case the server
      (upon job completion of job 2 - as per our<br>
      example) would immediately send the job 2 result back, and when it
      receives the results for job 2 back<br>
      it then will let any blocking call to receive(tagID) through. So
      we would implement this with a thread<br>
      per job on the client side - making the separate blocking calls
      possible - concurrently but the one job<br>
      that takes an hour will not hold ours up for an hour and a little
      bit - job 2's thread handler can receive its<br>
      results and do what it needs to with them.<br>
      <br>
      <h3>Using tristanable in your D project<br>
      </h3>
      You can easily add the library (source-based) to your project by
      running the following command in your<br>
      project's root:<br>
      <br>
      <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">dub add tristanable</font><br>
      <p><br>
      </p>
      <p><br>
        <br>
      </p>
