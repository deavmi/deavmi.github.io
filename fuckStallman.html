        [14:34:36] &lt;deavmi&gt; True<br>
        [14:34:45] &lt;deavmi&gt; Got any tips for setring up ripd<br>
        [14:34:50] &lt;deavmi&gt; Like a document or man page<br>
        [14:34:54] &lt;deavmi&gt; Cause that would be n i c e <br>
        [14:35:08] &lt;deavmi&gt; Hahaha static routing go brrr<br>
        [14:35:23] &lt;deavmi&gt; kaotisk: nice! What you working on?<br>
        [14:35:55] &lt;kaotisk&gt; radio.arching-kaos.tk<br>
        [14:38:02] &lt;kaotisk&gt; I have done an API for uploading
        mixes to the webradio.<br>
        [14:38:19] &lt;kaotisk&gt; Getting that stuff from a route<br>
        [14:38:52] &lt;deavmi&gt; nice<br>
        [14:39:02] &lt;deavmi&gt; When uni is done I can finally get
        back to work on bester<br>
        [14:39:07] &lt;kaotisk&gt; basically that two, and while you
        uploading some other things<br>
        [14:39:44] &lt;deavmi&gt; and implement something like IRC on it
        and also something akin to email. I also want to get working on
        some CRXN stuff for collecting router and host stats to build a
        nice websiet for getting all that information. <br>
        [14:39:48] &lt;deavmi&gt; kaotisk: nice!<br>
        [14:40:59] &lt;kaotisk&gt; thanks<br>
        [14:41:34] &lt;kaotisk&gt; it's secured with whitelist of IPs
        and in order to upload you have to be part of an IPFS swarm.<br>
        [14:41:35] &lt;deavmi&gt; My goals for bester are to first
        finish up the spec and make sure the protocol is sleek and
        everything as it has some rough-ish edges (but for the most part
        works as intended), then polish the hell out of the code base
        and lastly I need to make it thread safe with locks on global
        data structures because currently stuff ca go really wrong<br>
        [14:41:46] &lt;deavmi&gt; kaotisk: nice, I like the IPFS
        integration!<br>
        [14:41:56] &lt;kaotisk&gt; The A R C H I N G&nbsp; K A O S&nbsp;
        S W A RM<br>
        [14:41:59] &lt;kaotisk&gt; xD<br>
        [14:42:00] &lt;deavmi&gt; XD<br>
        [14:42:54] &lt;deavmi&gt; So yeah for me this side my roadmap of
        this year looks like this: Bester, IRC reimpl, email reimpl,
        refactor, clean up, thread safety, portability, CRXN stuff,
        BonoboNET stuff, ted editor, some more stuff<br>
        [14:42:56] &lt;deavmi&gt; Damn<br>
        [14:43:00] &lt;deavmi&gt; We're having fun!<br>

      [12:52:43] &lt;deavmi&gt; Idk what happened<br>
      [12:52:52] &lt;deavmi&gt; perhaps it failed due to a lag at

      [12:52:53] &lt;deavmi&gt; who knows<br>

      [13:00:17] &lt;deavmi&gt; adding a systemd unit with `sysctl -p`

      [13:00:23] &lt;deavmi&gt; No fucking idea why it is acting up now<br>

      [13:04:37] &lt;deavmi&gt; I haven't rebooted it in some time<br>
      [13:04:39] &lt;deavmi&gt; since recent changes<br>
      [13:04:42] &lt;deavmi&gt; I guess<br>
      [13:04:50] &lt;deavmi&gt; so perhaps it took to long to bring up
      eth0 eth1<br>
      [13:04:51] &lt;deavmi&gt; or rather<br>
      [13:04:56] &lt;deavmi&gt; not "too long"<br>
      [13:05:09] &lt;deavmi&gt; but it wasn't up as the kernel executed
      the sysctl <br>
      [13:05:24] &lt;deavmi&gt; and therefore it didn't work essentially<br>
      [13:05:39] &lt;deavmi&gt; or rather systemd starting sysctl and
      applying those changes to the kernel via procfs<br>
      [13:06:00] &lt;deavmi&gt; So now with the systemd unit, which only
      runs when the network is online (and waits 10 seconds), it then
      applies the sysctl -p<br>
      [13:06:07] &lt;deavmi&gt; THis is by far the busiest of machines I
      hav<br>
      [13:06:10] &lt;deavmi&gt; it does the ckr<br>
      [13:06:19] &lt;deavmi&gt; for crxn 10.5.0.1 and my 10.6.3.1<br>
      [13:06:20] &lt;deavmi&gt; so yeah<br>
      [13:06:26] &lt;deavmi&gt; I also did run babeldon it recently<br>
      [13:06:29] &lt;deavmi&gt; but rebooted afterwards<br>
      [13:06:32] &lt;deavmi&gt; so idk<br>
      [13:06:34] &lt;deavmi&gt; Seems fine now<br>
      [13:06:44] &lt;deavmi&gt; Defs going with the assumption on slow
      bring up of interface times<br>
      [13:06:56] &lt;deavmi&gt; as repeatedly inputting it in that conf
      file seemed to work in one case<br>
      [13:06:59] &lt;deavmi&gt; lSo yeah<br>
      [13:07:01] &lt;deavmi&gt; * So yeah<br>
      [13:07:21] &lt;deavmi&gt; I mean most of this stuff should be done
      through systemd anyways because of that factor<br>
      [13:08:11] &lt;deavmi&gt; I do the tun0 forwarding enabler in
      systemd unit as well (I actually have to because tun0 doesn't just
      autoplug itself like physical hardware does, ygg must first start)<br>
