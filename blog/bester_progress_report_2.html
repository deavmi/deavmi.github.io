      <h3>Introduction<br>
      </h3>
      I have another post still due with regards to Bester's sendServers
      and sendHandler commands but because that will take some time to
      write up I decided I would make a progress update as the
      specification for those functions is not complete (it changes as I
      code, and yes a final post will be made once the specification is
      stable). Anyways, let's get into it!</div>
    <div align="left"><br>
      <div align="left">
        <h3>Working message handlers<br>
        </h3>
        The whole flow of client to server, server to handler, handler
        to server and server to client (as described in the <a
          href="blog/bester_1.html">introduction to Bester post</a>) has
        been implemented and tests exist to test that functionality out.
        You can now have a client <b>T</b> send a message of type <b>S</b>
        to the server <b>J</b> and the handler for <b>S</b>-type
        messages will handle the message. <b>S</b> will do what it
        needs to and then, over a UNIX domain socket, transfer its
        response back to the server, <b>J</b>. Another little change to
        mention is that upon connecting to the handler we open a new
        connection to it each time, instead of the previous mechanism
        that connected on startup and used that socket for <b>all</b>
        messages of type <b>S</b>. Anywho, when server <b>J</b> has
        gotten a response back from <b>S</b> it will then see what the
        command is, these are sendHandler, sendServers and sendClient.
        For what I am speaking about it is sendClient we are interested
        in. The whole flow as described in the beginning works and the
        server will check the list of provided clients (from the message
        handler's response message) and send the payload of the message
        handler to each of those users.<br>
      </div>
      <div align="left"><br>
        <h3>Early working scope "server" (server-to-server)<br>
        </h3>
        A small little mention (rather big in my opinion) is that we now
        have a working server-to-server handling mechanism in response.d
        (which handles sendClients, sendServers and (soon) sendHandler),
        in fact the images you see later are of that all working (which
        also implies a working message handler system, as described
        above).<br>
        <br>
        <h3>Exceptions everywhere and code clean up<br>
        </h3>
        It is worth the mention that exception handling is making its
        way into the codebase. For example, a failure to send to on of
        the clients in the scenario mentioned above will not break the
        whole response-handling mechanism but rather skip to the next
        client and attempt sending to it. It is quite shoddy right now
        but that is just to have it in a non-breakable state. There will
        come a time, I think in probably a month's time whereby code
        clean up can be done.<br>
      </div>
      <div align="left"><br>
        Speaking of code clean up, a lot has been done to abstract and
        modularise everything. Most message handling code is now part of
        the "handlers" package and the entry point of through a
        MessageHandler object. Things will continue to follow this OOP
        design pattern till I am satisfied with the code hiding such
        that each module only calls external functions in those other
        mdules and the code in each module is solely related to the
        module itself - not another module.<br>

        <h3>Some photos of it working<br>
        </h3>
        To wrap up this post I think sharing the latest screenshots of
        it working would be a good idea.<br>

          What you see above is a client <b>A</b> connected to a server
          <b>B</b>, and the right-hand side pane is client <b>A</b>
          authenticated with<br>
          the server and sending a message to it (of type "type1"). The
          output of the constructed is then printed below it.<br>

            What you see here is handler <b>C</b> receiving the message
            that was sent from client <b>A</b> to the server <b>B</b>.
            It<br>
            has now been dispatched to the message handler <b>C</b>
            which has now printed out that received message.</div>

                What you now see is the response that the message

                server <b>B</b> sent client <b>A</b>'s

                <div align="center">it contains one server to send to,

                  Server B -&gt; Server D -&gt; Handler E</font><br>
                <div align="center"><br>
                  What has happened now is that the sendServers command
                  from server <b>C</b> has come into affect and
                  transferred the<br>
                  response payload form handler <b>C</b> to server <b>D</b>,
                  the received payload has the "scope" field set to
                  "server" and hence<br>
                  no authentication needs to take place. The same
                  handling steps however do occur, therefore the payload
                  has a "type"<br>
                  field which will be used on server <b>D</b> to direct
                  the message to the corresponding handler which in this
                  case is handler<br>
                  <b>E</b>, which you can see here above has received
                  the payload.<br>
                </div>
                <div align="center"><br>
                </div>
                <div align="center"><br>

                <div align="center"><br>
                </div>
                <div align="center"><br>
                </div>
                <div align="center"><br>
                </div>
                <div align="center"><br>

                  <div align="center"><br>
                    Clearly this is a work in progress and the message
                    that handler <b>E</b> generates is not what the
                    server expects, I<br>
                    have a few of these kinks that need working on (as a
                    result from not having a solid specification yet).</div>
