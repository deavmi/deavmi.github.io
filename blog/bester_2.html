      <h3>Introduction<br>
      </h3>
      So, you've probably seen the previous blog posts and now have seen
      that both sendClients and sendServers have been implemented. This
      post aims to re-iterate those features but with the addition of
      sendHandler which has been added as well. Things are still rough
      but I have been able to test it out with
      sendClients+sendServers+sendHandler all in one setup and it did
      work. The example I share today is possible but of course requires
      quite some setup and many.... many handlers. But without further
      a-do, let's take a look at an example to explain the system again
      and then later the real world example I actually deployed.<br>

      <h3>A worked example to explain it (again)<br>
      </h3>
      So we start off with the familiar characters again, the Bester
      gang, no wait... maybe just <i>"the squad"</i>. There's a guy, he
      had something to say and he wants to say it, let's call him <b>T</b>.
      In the Bester sense he (<b>T</b>) is a client to a Bester server.
      Depicted below is <b>T</b> with an envelope with his message he
      wants to send. The server is the box labeled <i>Magic Machine</i>.<br>
    </div>
    <div align="left"><br>
    </div>
    <div align="center"><img src="bester_images_2/image1.jpeg" alt=""
        height="633" width="595"></div>
    <div align="left"><br>
    </div>
    <div align="left">He wants to send a message that speaks in a <i>tongue</i>,
      the Bester version of this is a message-type or sub-protocol.
      Luckily his server, the <b>Magic Machine</b>, has a <b>gadget</b>
      which is another word for a message handler, of the specific <i>tongue</i>
      (sub-protocol) that the message is encoded in and sendClients is
      being used here for the reply of the message handler to be routed
      back to the client, <b>T</b>.<br>
    </div>
    <div align="left"><br>
      All <b>T</b> has to do is send it to the Magic Machine, get a
      reply and there you go! But after sometime he got lonely speaking
      just to himself, so he decided to say hello to his friend <b>G</b>
      but sadly it was lockdown and <b>T</b> was a law-abiding citizen
      and adhered to the curfew so they decided to meet virtually.<br>
    </div>
    <div align="left"><br>
    </div>
    <div align="center"><img src="bester_images_2/image2.jpeg" alt=""
        height="400" width="598"><br>
    </div>
    <div align="left"><br>
    </div>
    <div align="left"><b>G</b> was in the same position, she was talking
      to her own <b>Magical Boks</b>, so if both of them were then
      what's to stop them from just connecting the two together? Surely
      all the gadgets in her <i>boks<b> </b></i>will work with those
      in <b>T</b>'s? As exciting as this situation was, this was a
      stumbling block. You see <b>T</b> had gadgets that only spoke
      English (an example sub-protocol) and <b>G</b> had gadgets (in
      her <i>boks</i>) that only spoke Afrikaans (an example of a
      sub-protocol, again).<br>
    </div>
    <div align="left"><br>
      How could they fix this? Simple, they forgot they they once
      exchanged copies of their gadgets before because they knew
      multilingualism was important. All they had to do was to make sure
      to both have an English and an Afrikaans gadget (message handler)
      installed in their boxes (servers). This meant that they could
      exchange both messages in English and Afrikaans, or selectively
      one or the other if they decided to only attach the Afrikaans
      gadget.<br>
    </div>
    <div align="left"><br>
      Quick aside, so far we have two servers that can interact with
      each other with two possible protocols, either both matching
      "English" or both matching "Afrikaans" (the possible message types
      and their associated handlers are what we have been calling
      gadgets).<br>
    </div>
    <div align="left"><br>
      This is fantastic, they can now communicate!<br>
    </div>
    <div align="left"><br>
      <div align="center"><img src="bester_images_2/image3.jpeg" alt=""
          height="474" width="654"><br>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div align="left"><br>
    </div>
    <div align="left"><br>
      Infact, you could do crazy stuff like this even (server-to-server,
      via the sendServers command):<br>
      <div align="center"><br>
        <img src="bester_images_2/image4.jpeg" alt="" height="424"
          width="538"><br>
      </div>
      <br>
    </div>
    <div align="left"><br>
      This was really great for the two of them, friends re-united.
      However, sometimes <b>T</b> wanted to be able to just, you know,
      speak in the language of a once world-empire, Portuguese! However,
      <b>G</b> didn't have the gadget you needed to understand such
      messages and she didn't want to purchase it either as none of her
      friends, except <b>T</b>, spoke Portuguese (how sad). <b>T</b>
      knew this but he also knew that he could translate the messages on
      his side (the client translating a message from a type not
      supported by the server to one that is supported and <b>then</b>
      only sending it), but he knew this was tiresome and if his box <i>is</i>
      to be all magical and all then surely it could provide such a
      feature and <b>T</b> knew he could afford a Portuguese gadget.</div>
    <div align="left"><br>
    </div>
    <div align="center"><img src="bester_images_2/image5.jpeg" alt=""
        height="318" width="736"></div>
    <div align="left"><br>
      <b>T</b> found out that if he added his Portuguese gadget to his
      magical machine that he could make it work in a way that when a
      Portuguese-tongued message came in, that gadget (handler), would
      redirect it's translated message to the English gadget (also a
      handler) which would then send it to <b>G</b>'s <i>boks</i>.
      This, in the Bester sense, is making use of the sendHandler
      command, and then the sendServers command. <br>
    </div>
    <div align="left"><br>
      <div align="center"><img src="bester_images_2/image6.jpeg" alt=""
          height="706" width="682"><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      This is the power of Bester, servers connecting to servers with
      very little clue what the messages they transfer entail but just
      an understanding of where to send the message-handler's replies
      to. With such a system you can write sub-protocols ontop of it to
      make it do whatever you want. Perhaps a chat protocol, maybe
      e-mail, maybe something that updates you on the status of your
      Internet-connected kitchen. Instead of you having to write your
      own protocol fully - in the sense that you must deal with basic
      authentication and server-to-server sockets and client-to-server
      sockets and handler sockets. You just have to construct JSON
      correctly, that's all I ask of you, and a little 4 byte size
      header (in little endian).<br>

      <h3>My actual deployment<br>
      </h3>
      Sadly in this world I will first need to write a few handlers and
      clean up the server's code before I can convince <b>G</b> to use
      Bester but as for myself and testing the software goes I was able
      to construct a topology as shown below.<br>
    </div>
    <div align="left"><br>
    </div>
    <div align="center"><img src="bester_images_2/image8.jpeg" alt=""
        height="750" width="551"></div>
    <div align="left"><br>
    </div>
    <div align="left">What you see here is a user <b>U1</b> connected
      to a server <b>S1</b> who (U1) then sends a message of type <b>M1</b>
      to the server <b>S1</b>. This is then processed by the message
      handler for type <b>M1</b>, <b>M1</b>. <b>M1</b> decides to not
      use sendClients or sendServers as part of its response message
      back to the server <b>S1</b> but rather (although not depicted)
      sends its reply back to <b>S1</b> with the command sendHandler
      (stating to send it to <b>M2</b>), finally <b>M2</b> sends a
      reply back to the server with command sendServers specifying to
      send it to server <b>S2</b>.<br>
    </div>
    <div align="left"><br>
      Server <b>S2</b> gets the message which has message-type <b>M1</b>,
      therefore the message handler <b>M1</b> will take the message and
      generate a reply and send it back to the server <b>S2</b> but
      with the command sendServers specifying to send the reply to
      server <b>S3</b>.<br>
    </div>
    <div align="left"><br>
      Server <b>S3</b> gets the reply, the message is of type <b>M1</b>,
      it sends it to <b>M1</b>, <b>M1</b> replies back to <b>S3</b>
      with its reply and the command sendClients specifying to send the
      reply to the client (locally attached only) <b>U2</b>.<br>
