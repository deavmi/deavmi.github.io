      <h3>Introduction<br>
      </h3>
      As a break from writing the next post on Bester and how it can be
      used in server-to-server contexts I decided a little, more
      technical, progress report was due.<br>

        <h3>Adding multiple listeners<br>
        </h3>
        Something I wanted to add badly and have as a nice little extra
        feature, not something that was inherent to the bester protocol
        itself, was to add support for IPv6 to the bester daemon.
        Therefore last night, after most of my university work had been
        completed I decided that it was time to slightly refactor the
        way the server listened for incoming connections. Instead of the
        <i>accept-and-dispatch</i> loop being a part of the <font
          face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">BesterServer</font>
        class I decided that that class should, yes, still be the
        central point of coordination in terms of keeping track of <b>all</b>
        connections but that connections should be appended to the <font
          face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">BesterConnection[]</font>
        array via the listeners that were running. I wanted to allow the
        user to be able to let their server, if they wanted to, be able
        to bind to TCP over IPv4 along with binding to TCP over IPv6 as
        well and even, maybe, UNIX domain sockets!<br>
      </div>
      <div align="left"><br>
        The way I worked this out in the code was by creating a class
        named <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">BesterListener</font>
        which ran on its own thread and had an already implemented
        connection <i>accept-and-dispatch</i> loop for dispatching new
        connections to <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">BesterConnection</font>
        thread objects. Then for implementing specific protocols like
        TCP over IPv4 or over IPv6 or using UNIX domain sockets, all I
        did was to create several other classes that extended the <font
          face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">BesterListener</font>
        class and justset the super-class's <font face="Courier New,
          Courier, monospace">socket</font> object to the one created
        for that specific protocol.<br>
        <div align="left"><br>
          And it worked like a charm!<br>
        </div>
        <div align="left"><br>
          The configuration for something like this looks like this in <font
            face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">server.conf</font>:<br>
        </div>
        <div align="left">&nbsp; <br>
          <pre>&nbsp;&nbsp; network" : {</pre>
          <pre>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;"types" : ["unix", "tcp4", "tcp6"],</pre>
          <pre>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;"unix" : {</pre>
          <pre>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;"address" : "besterUNIXSock"</pre>
          <pre>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;},</pre>
          <pre>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;"tcp4" : {</pre>
          <pre>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;"port" : "2220",</pre>
          <pre>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;"address" : "0.0.0.0"</pre>
          <pre>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;},</pre>
          <pre>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;"tcp6" : {</pre>
          <pre>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;"port" : "2221",</pre>
          <pre>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;"address" : "::"</pre>
          <pre>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;}</pre>
          <pre>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;}</pre>
        </div>
        <div align="left"><br>
          So all you need to do is specify that you want certain socket
          types and then just provide their binding informations.<br>

          <h3>A new addition to the <font face="Courier New, Courier,
              monospace">sendClients</font> and <font face="Courier
              New, Courier, monospace">sendServers</font> response
            commands<br>
          </h3>
          As I was discussing bester with a friend of mine, he
          indirectly gave me an idea for something interesting I wanted
          to implement. Normally if a user wants to get some processing
          done by a handler, we currently have it working as follows.
          Client sends a message to the server, server gets it and
          dispatches it to the message handler. The only part that we
          haven't done is handling of the reply that the server receives
          back from the message handler. We have the reply working in
          that it comes back but we haven't done much with regards to
          that. So <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">sendClient</font>
          and <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">sendServer</font>
          are essentially not implemented. But in the example where say
          now a user wants a message <b>A</b> to be processed by a
          handler for <b>messageType1</b> but then wants the response
          it gets back from the handler (indirectly via the server) to
          be processed again by another handler, then the user must send
          another message (the processed one, back). Now, I don't mind
          this and of course you can still do this after the next
          feature I am going to mention gets implemented, but the thing
          I was thinking of doing was implementing a command named <font
            face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">sendHandler</font>,
          which means after the server received a message from the
          client and dispatched it to the <b>messageType1</b> message
          handler that it (the handler) can then generate a response
          message that commands the server to push that message to
          another handler and then somewhere down the line the server
          gets a response with a command that is not <font
            face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">sendHandler</font>
          and the message ends back at a client or another server (<b>sendClients</b>
          and <b>sendServers</b> respectively).<br>
        </div>
        <div align="left"><br>
          <h3>Take it for a run yourself!<br>
          </h3>
          All you have to do is clone the repository (<a
            href="https://github.com/besterprotocol/besterd">here</a>)
          and then <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">cd</font>
          into and run the following.<br>
        </div>
        <div align="left"><br>
          Firstly <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">cd
            testing/</font> and then run <font face="Courier New,
            Courier, monospace">python3 unixSock.py</font>, this starts
          a bogus message handler. Now, start the bester daemon by
          running <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">dub</font>,
          and then lastly run a client example code by running <font
            face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">cd testing</font> and
          <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">python3
            testSuite.py</font>!<br>
        </div>
        <div align="left"><br>
          You should see some output!<br>
