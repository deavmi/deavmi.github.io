    Damn, it's been a really busy last few months with this whole
    statist lockdown in South Africa. Now to get the politics out of the
    way - I hate lockdown but damn has it made me productive. It's in
    this post that I hope to shed some light on absolutely everything I
    have been working on in the last few months (which damn has been a
    lot). I'll be going through a lot of what life has been like here,
    what my projects have developed into and the new ones I have created
    and then lastly the side-projects of mine (the physical things) that
    I have been working on as of late. I'm writing this in the backseat
    of my parents' car as we drive down to Stellenbosch to my university
    to pickup the leftover belongings of mine that were left there the
    day I left home due to the university closing due to the 'rona.<br>

    <i>So let's get to it then!</i><br>
    <br>
    <h3>A life catchup</h3>
    <p>Life under lockdown sucks, I mean other than it being an
      infringement on my rights (and no I don't care about the
      constitution's exceptions made for "disaster management"), it has
      been really shitty. First of all my birthday will have to be moved
      possibly because how else are we going to get wine then unless we
      wait for cunt-worthy regulations (those banning alcahol) to be
      lifted. The second being that I cannot enjoy campus life as well -
      this being a centerpiece of what it means to be a part of
      university culture - this time is stolen from me and I will never
      get it back - yes, I'm looking at you Stellenbosch Universiteit -
      y'all really look like damn asses in this situations and it is
      nothing to be proud of. SO it'ss a whole fuck up from the state
      level down to the University's administrators which yes can do
      what they want if they really wanted but their choice was lame -
      rather have it open in protest. So now we had to go online and
      have tests online and all of that - now the semester went well - I
      got good marks and now I'm on holiday <b>but still</b> I would
      have preferred being on campus this whole time. Now looking back
      at it, after how productive I have been, oerhaps not - I am
      conflicted but what I am assured is that the next semester should
      be on campus - I have gotten my personal project work that I
      wanted to cpmplete done, so now let me go back - I'll have no
      benefit that I did above here by being at home, so I think then my
      above protest can be applied for the next semester - it's valid
      now!<br>
    </p>
    <p>So what did I get up to? Well, a lot of things, CRXN, BonoboNET,
      Bester, libutterfly, bformat, skoenlapper, Butterflyd and many
      more! I'll describe a little bit of what I worked on during such a
      productive time in the next section but first - a weather report.<br>
    </p>
    <p>It's been frikken freezing here in Worcester. Damn, the mountain
      tops were snowy-as-fuck (saf) and it was super cold but it made
      the inside of the house very nice and cozy so I enjoyed that
      aspect of it - in front of the fireplace.<br>

    Now that I am back home from collecting my stuff at Stellenbosch,
    let's get to it (politics time is over).<br>
    <br>
    <h3><a href="/projects/bonobonet">BonoboNET</a> - the best irc
      network<br>
    </h3>
    Something I have always wanted to do was to setup an IRC network.
    The main reasons was because it is easy to do and it is a cool thing
    to have - I mean chat - <b>that's super cool!</b> I had played
    around with the IRC daemon our network uses, <i>ngircd</i>, a few
    years prior and it was hella easy to get setup with 3 nodes so from
    there I knew it would be a doable project in a short amount of time.
    So I got a few things setup. I setup an original node called <i>corona.bnet</i>,
    because corona is a meme. That machine had Yggdrasil on it so that
    it could be reachable on a network other than my home IP subnet
    (which is unreachable by everyone but me on it (and my family of
    course)). I got some people to come along and connect but I think
    that was only later, after I had moved the job from that machine to
    my new machine - <i>lockdown.bnet</i> (and so we say farewell to
    corona.bnet - the O.G. BNET node!). That machine stayed in place on
    my server rack in the form of a Raspberry Pi - then a few users
    started to come along and join in. Next thing you know, I was
    starting to get people not just on the network but also peering them
    server-wise as new nodes onto the network making it an actual
    network not just a one node (lockdown.bnet here) IRC network.<br>
    <br>
    What happened next was what we will call <i>the great split</i>
    whereby we basically had some folk move over to charybdis (puke mode
    activated). However, I got some other people to fill their spot
    server wise - we're still good friends (laughing emoji). So now
    we're on the node count we were previously with one node more!<br>
    <br>
    Setting it up was and still is a very fun past time. It's fun to see
    the different ways we can make connections with other nodes, whether
    it be over the regular internet, over CRXN, Yggdrasil or more! It
    makes thee already interesting topology even more interesting and
    having something that we can use to communicate that we, the
    community, put together it very cool!<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <div align="center"><img src="catch_up_1/4.png" alt="Topology of
        BonoboNET" height="505" width="714"><br>
      <br>
      Topology of BonoboNET<br>
    </div>
    <br>
    <br>
    So BonoboNET is a very fun project because, as I will mention next
    with CRXN, it is nice to, once you have an IP internet, have
    something to actually run on top of it and use it for.<br>
    <br>
    <b>If you're interested then following this <a
        href="/projects/bonobonet">link</a> where you can get connected
      and also, if you want to join your ngircd server onto the network.</b><br>
    <br>
    <h3><a href="/projects/crxn">CRXN</a> - the best IP inter-network<br>
    </h3>
    Something I have been planning for a <b>very long time</b> is to
    build my own IP inter-network after all of the self-teaching I have
    done for IP networking and networking in general. I wanted to have
    something whereby I could setup routing myself, configure the routes
    then the IP addresses and then the physical aspects like switches
    and ethernet cables and so on and so on. That came to life during
    lockdown. I set a day aside to configure my network. I decided I now
    could put my 3 Raspberry Pis (I now have 5) to good use. I setup the
    two to both be routers, and placed a switch in between them and then
    one on either side (so three in total).<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <div align="center"><img src="catch_up_1/5.jpg" alt="" height="631"
        width="843"><br>
      <br>
      Switch 1 &lt;--&gt; Router 1 (<b>Pi3</b>) &lt;--&gt; Switch 2
      &lt;--&gt; Router 2 (<b>Pi1</b>) &lt;--&gt; Switch 3<br>
      The middle node is actually my <i>lockdown.bnet</i> BonoboNET
      node.<br>
      <br>
      <div align="left"><br>
        You can't see the two switches in the above photo but we will
        get to them later. So, as I was saying, I went ahead and
        configured the whole thing. Got subnets assigned both sides (so
        routes added), enabled forwarding and then placed a machine on
        either end and did a test ping, and not much to my surprise <b>it

          worked!</b> (As I had done this before). Now over the time I
        would come to realize that I need to get other people on this
        network to make it more interesting.<br>
        <br>
        Now, I wanted to get more things and people onto CRXN really
        badly - so I did what I knew best - <b>spam it everywhere!</b>
        I first did a test run of using Yggdrasil's Crypto-Key routing,
        which let's you tunnel traffic from one node to another such
        that it pops up on the tun0 interface on the destination node's
        side - ready for accepting into the kernel's networking stack. I
        did that between a machine of mine and a VM (the final time, as
        I had done earlier tests but this was a working one - working
        properly that is). I saw that that was working and then came the
        first interesting part to the addition of new routes into the
        inter-network, Chris's IPv6 NETMAPPING router.<br>
        <br>
        <a href="http://chrisnew.de">Chris</a> and I linked up and I
        added a route on my side for 10.5.0.1/32 to point to his
        Yggdrasil node so he could do NETMAP-NAT, which would mean he
        could make the whole of CRXN available, through NAT, on the IPv6
        Internet. This means any traffic coming in would be an IPv6
        packet that then would strip it into payload and place in in an
        IPv4 packet with the source IP of 10.5.0.1 and then the
        destination IP that is a result of the mapping function of
        getIPv4(IPv6In) - something that Chris defined his side. This is
        a neat feature to have on the network as now we have every
        device available and through the best type of NAT - one that
        allows raw sockets, so instead of port-mapping we have address
        mapping!<br>
        <br>
        After getting the hang f Yggdrasil's CKR I started to get a lot
        of people on the network by this method (and still have many
        more who want to join it - so much so I should start thinking
        about network structuring at this point). Another method I
        should look to in the future is using CJDNS for this as well -
        it too has a CKR feature which I can use for those who want to
        get peered with CJDNS or for the same Yggdrasil peerings I have
        to have a redundant backup! Another thing that would be nice
        would be to see Lokinet introducing CKR at some point in time -
        that would mean I would have 3 methods of tunneling available
        that I could use for those who lack the other overlay networks
        or to increase redundancy between existing links.<br>
        <br>
        So now for a deep dive into what the network consists of my
        side, <b>routers</b>, <b>switches</b>, <b>hosts</b> and a lot
        of <b>wires</b><b>!<br>

            <i>jaco</i> and <i>bester</i> are used for various
            different things. Currently I run on the network services
            for public consumption on <i>bester</i>, this includes a
            KiwiIRC instance for web irc access to BonoboNET, ssh-chat
            (a shell server where the shell is a chat program), a few
            matterbridge instances to bridge BonoboNET to what will be a
            volatile IRC joining (on a few channels), a gitea instance
            (which I use for git mirroring), a redmine instance (for
            managing projects and media files for project notes and such
            type of documents that aren't suitable for a repository). <i>Silverfish

            </i>or <i>bernd</i> I use for software testing for
            Butterfly and such with several docker containers, <i>jaco</i>
            - much of the same. <i>Brink</i>, nice guy, but he ain't
            doing much right now (I mean damn that thing has a strapped
