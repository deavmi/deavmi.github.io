    <h3>Continuing where we left...<br>
    </h3>
    So <a href="/projects/bonobonet">BobonoNET</a> is now growing and
    we have a few users (most albeit on a bridge) but some new native
    users I am convincing to join now are coming on - which is great! As
    for <a href="projects/bonobonet">CRXN</a> we have had users, like <a
      href="http://chrisnew.de">Chris</a>, join from Germany, and <a
      href="http://n4vn33t.com">Clickme.sh</a> from India, soon the US
    too with some other folks!<br>
    <br>
    Now let's move onto the next things!<br>
    <br>
    <h3><a href="https://deavmi.github.io/projects/bester">Bester</a><br>
    </h3>
    So I started work on what I see as a more modular XMPP which I call
    Bester. I have written quite a few blog posts on it (look here, here
    and here). And basically what Bester provides is an authenticated
    mechanism whereby a client can send some data into the Bester
    daemon, then message handlers (which are separate processes that
    connect over UNIX domain sockets to the Bester daemon) will handle
    specific messages of specific types and then produce an output for
    them, basically your message goes into the server (the Bster daemon)
    -&gt; to a message handler -&gt; and then the output from the
    message handler can be directed either back to the users on the same
    server, users on the same server and remote servers or, and get
    this, back into another message handler (and then the same process
    applies).<br>
    <br>
    With such a system I am to make some cool IoT systems, filtering
    systems and connected-goodness - I also plan to make a chat program
    that works on top of Bester as I think that will work out well!<br>
    <br>
    There is a rough working version (I mean it isn't that bad,
    everything works but I want to make it more thread safe etc. and
    cleaner - the implementation) whereby you can do pretty cool things
    in terms of topologies of Bester daemons and moving messages
    throughout them!<br>
    <br>
    <h3><a href="https://deavmi.github.io/projects/butterfly">Butterfly</a>
      - electronic mail simplified <br>
    </h3>
    I don't think I have yet posted much on Butterfly or at all - only
    really on Mastodon! Now I have always wanted to have email but in an
    easier to setup way and something that just worked in a more simpler
    way - now I haven't looked at the email spec but the fact setting up
    proper email requires two daemons (one for SMTP and one for IMAP)
    was already enough for me so I said, in usual Deavmi terms "fuck it,
    I'm reinventing the wheel - except this time it won't be a bicycle
    but a unicycle as was the bare minimum requirements (wait until you
    see how mail filtering is <i>proposed</i> to work).<br>
    <br>
    So I started work on it and now the basic functionality is all there
    including inter-server mail exchange the only things left to do are
    thread safety, performance increasing via tristanable and code clean
    up and a few more functions like mail deletion, folder deletion etc.
    but the mail aspect of sending and receiving and checking your inbox
    and fetching mail are all there!<br>
    <br>
    So what I am to do with mail filtering is to have some generic
    protocol that others can use to build filtering daemons - yes I lied
    - filtering requires another daemon but at least you'll be able to
    disable this feature -_-. I plan on making Bester apart of this
    aspect but not bundled in anyway and separate - I want to maintain
    the UNIX philosophies - do one thing and do it well!<br>
    <br>
    <h3><a href="https://deavmi.github.io/projects/tristanable">tristanable</a>
      - tag-based messaging library<br>
    </h3>
    Now for both Bester and Butterfly I want to make things more
    job-oriented than based around a simple state machine. By this I
    mean that if I have two jobs, job 1 and job 2, then rather than
    making it such that I make a request from the client -&gt; server to
    start job 1 and then await the completion and result from server
    -&gt; client and then do the same for job 2, I want to submit both
    jobs, job 1 and then job 2 and as soon as one finishes then I want
    to receive its result - now one can program this but the thing is
    that means programming the same thing time and time again for
    several programs, just like bformat (which you will see in the next
    section), so I decided to write a library to do this for me.<br>
    <br>
    tristanable is for the client side, obviously with worker threads
    for each job on the server-side this is easy to accomplish without a
    library - all the library does is listen for incoming results and
    store them in an array that you can access using functions like
    `.receive(tag=1)` (where tag is the same concept as job) which, if
    the result for the tag/job 1 is not in the array it will then loop
    and check but if it does find it sometime during that loop, or even
    before the first iteration then the `.receive` function will return
    immediately - this is the crux of tristanable.<br>
    <br>
    <h3><a href="https://github.com/besterprotocol/bformat">bformat</a>
      - socket encoding/decoding payload-management thing<br>
    </h3>
    This library, which should be renamed, basically manages receiving
    and sending of messages in the bformat format which consists of [
    &lt;---- 4 bytes (specifying size in little endian encoding)
    ----&gt; | &lt;---- payload (n bytes) ----&gt; ].<br>
    <br>
    I use this in all of my networking projects - at least so far.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3>And that's a wrap!<br>
    </h3>
    I should mention also that I started a <a
      href="https://video.autizmo.xyz/video-channels/deavmis_shack/videos">PeerTube
      channel</a> whereby I post computer builds and networking
    server-ish stuff - so check that out if you will!<br>
