    So BobonoNET is now growing and we have a few users (most albeit on
    a bridge) but some new native users I am convincing to join now are
    coming on - which is great! As for CRXN we have had users, like <a
      href="http://chrisnew.de">Chris</a>, join from Germany, and <a
      href="http://n4vn33t.com">Clickme.sh</a> from India, soon the US
    too with some other folks!<br>
