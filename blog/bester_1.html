      <h3>Introduction<br>
      </h3>
      I had enough time, during lockdown, to actually start on some of
      the ideas I had been wanting to start on for quite some time. I
      had an idea of something along the lines of XMPP but more <i>generalised</i>.
      Now I say it in italics because XMPP can actually and is used in a
      general sense, like for IoT devices - atleast one of the available
      XMPP daemons, I believe ejabberd, advertised itself as that once.
      For me though I wanted my own version and I guess as simple as
      possible - once again I have not read the XMPP specification so I
      think I might just be on par with it. Anyways, the point is I
      wanted my own version of it, now... what <b>is</b> it?<br>

      <h3>A worked example to explain it<br>
      </h3>
      So the idea behind the bester protocol is that by itself it is
      pretty useless except for a few built-in commands for admin but
      those don't really <b>do</b> anything. The idea behind bester is
      that two users let's call them G and T, because Alice and Bob is
      overused (and Eve is the weird dude that hangs out in NARGA H in
      the evenings). So we have a user named <b>G</b> and a user named
      <b>T</b>, <b>G</b> is connected to server <b>J</b> and so is <b>T</b>
      (as shown below):<br>
    </div>
    <div align="left"><br>
    </div>
    <div align="center"><img src="bester_images/1.png" alt="T speaking
        to G through J" height="276" width="448"><br>
    </div>
    <div align="left"><br>
    </div>
    <div align="left">Now let's say that <b>G</b> and <b>T</b> both
      have some sort of protocol they know how to speak, perhaps it's
      Afrikaans. Now, if <b>T</b> wants to send something encoded in
      the <i>Afrikaans protocol</i>, to <b>G</b>, then you would
      expect, in such a server-client model, for the server, <b>J</b>,
      itself to understand what the protocol is <b>too!</b> This is
      where the difference with bester comes in, as compared to say now
      using WhatsApp. In the WhatsApp scenario, that server <b>J</b>,
      would also need to understand the <i>Afrikaans protocol</i>. With
      bester, the <b>server</b> doesn't need to understand it <b><i>but</i></b>
      there must be something then surely that does? Say hello to the <i>message

        handler</i>!</div>
    <div align="left"><br>
    </div>
    <div align="center"><img src="bester_images/2.png" alt="The message
        handler" height="211" width="587"><br>
    </div>
    <div align="left"><br>
      Every message that follows the bester protocol <b>must</b>
      include a <i>type field</i>, this indicates to the server, <b>J</b>,
      which sub-protocol this message is encoded with and to which <i>messgage

        handler</i> the message should be dispatched to. In this case we
      can call the little message handler, <b>S</b> (this one's pretty
      ambigious). When <b>J</b> was setup, the server administrator
      made sure that his bester server could handle <i>Afrikaans </i>messages

      so therefore the server <b>J</b> will forward the message sent
      from <b>T</b> to <b>J</b>. The handler can do really anything it
      wants in its own space, it runs as a seperate process and
      communicates with the server over local IPC via a UNIX domain
      socket.<br>
    </div>
    <div align="left"><br>
      <div align="center"><img src="bester_images/3.png" alt="The
          message handler, S, exchanging a message and message-response
          with the server J" height="258" width="636"><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      Once the processing is done by the message handler <b>S</b>, then
      there are a few things that can happen. One for sure is that <b>S</b>
      must send s response, back to <b>J</b> who is waiting for one.
      This response contains a few built-in commands that can tell the
      server, <b>J</b>, what to do with the message that <b>S</b>
      created in reply to <b>J</b> passing on the <i>Afrikaans</i>
      message from <b>T</b> to it. These commands basically boil down
      to whether the generated message (by <b>S</b>) should be sent
      back to clients connected to the server <b>J</b> or if it should
      be sent to other servers (we will get to this in a moment).<br>
    </div>
    <div align="left"><br>
      So the idea is that <b>J</b> will receive messages and send back
      replies to either clients or forward to another server (not
      discusses yet). The fact that <b>T</b> was able to get the server
      to send the message encoded in the <i>Afrikaans protocol</i>
      wasn't because the server <b>J</b> understood <i>Afrikaans</i>
      but rather because it knows two built-in commands <b>sendClients</b>
      and <b>send</b><b>Servers</b> which are for sending the payload
      generated by the message handler for <i>Afrikaans</i>, <b>S</b>.
      <b>S</b> would have seen that within the <i>Afrikaans protocol</i>
      (because it understands it just like <b>T</b> and <b>G</b> do)
      there is a field that says who the message must be sent to and
      because of this, <b>S</b> can process the message it received,
      generate a new one (a response) and command the server <b>J</b>
      (who can't speak or understand <i>Afrikaans</i>) to use the <b>sendClients</b>
      command to forward it to the correct client attached to the local
      server <b>J</b>, in this case, client <b>G</b>.<br>
    </div>
    <div align="left"><br>
      So to make it clear, all the server knows is how to receive
      messages from clients, where to process them (done by the message
      handler), and then two commands that can be used by the message
      handler's generated message to command the server where to send
      its generated response.<br>
    </div>
    <div align="left"><br>

    <div align="center"><img src="bester_images/4.png" alt="T sending an
        Afrikaans protocol message to G through server J which handles
        the Afrikaans sub-protocol by exchanging messages with message

    <div align="left"><br>
      For now that is all, I will be writing on how server-to-server (so
      think <b>sendServers</b>) communication works and with a worked
      example too, in the next blog post.<br>
